            <h3>Reading Frictions, Eating and Sleeping</h3>
            <p>Searching the true meaning of life along with a job. Life is so fency sometimes and sometimes it likes
                gloomy
                sky. Wish to be a bird and fly in the sky at the night of fullmoon. Sometimes wishing to be a
                fisherman,make
                a home in a bote and live with fishes.We love the things we love for what they are.In three words I can
                sum
                up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the
                heart's
                affections, and the truth of imagination.Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is
                to
                school an intelligence and make it a soul?Land and sea, weakness and decline are great separators, but
                death
                is the great divorcer for ever.
